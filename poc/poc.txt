Here are some fun facts about koalas:
1.	Not Actually Bears – Despite often being called “koala bears,” they are actually marsupials, meaning they carry and nurse their young in a pouch.
2.	Specialized Diet – Koalas eat almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals. Their specialized digestive system detoxifies the leaves.
3.	Sleepy Creatures – Koalas sleep for about 18–22 hours a day because eucalyptus leaves provide very little energy.
4.	Unique Fingerprints – Their fingerprints are so similar to humans’ that they can sometimes confuse forensic investigators!
5.	Built for Climbing – They have two opposable thumbs on each hand, helping them grip tree branches securely.
6.	Water from Leaves – The word “koala” is thought to mean “no water” in an Aboriginal language, as they get most of their hydration from eucalyptus leaves.
7.	Baby Koalas Eat “Pap” – Koala joeys transition from milk to eucalyptus by eating their mother’s “pap”—a special nutrient-rich poop that helps them digest toxic leaves.
8.	Distinct Smell – Male koalas have a scent gland on their chest that produces a strong musky odor to mark territory and attract females.
9.	Vocal but Cute – Despite their adorable appearance, koalas can make deep, grunting sounds, which are surprisingly loud for their size.
10.	Independent from Birth – Newborn koalas (joeys) are the size of a jellybean and must crawl into their mother’s pouch to continue developing.
